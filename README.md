# Eve

Electron app testbed!

# Getting started

```

npm install -g cmake-js
cp config.example.js config.js
npm install && npm start

```

If you are having problems with mismatching modules, ensure that the node version is the same as:
https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/.node-version
Otherwise, downgrade electron-prebuilt to v1.2.8.
